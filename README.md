# Stock-Market-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP

NLP-based system for analyzing market sentiment from stock-related news and generating weekly summaries to support investment decisions.

## Objective
Due to the high volume of stock market news, investors often struggle to analyze sentiment and extract key insights in a timely manner.  
The objective of this project is to build machine learning–based news sentiment classification models and leverage large language models for weekly news summarization to support informed investment decisions.

## Techniques
- Text embeddings: GloVe, Word2Vec, Sentence Transformers: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Hugging Face LLMs for content summarization, sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6
## Results
- Word2vec along with Random forest classification performed well in terms of F1 Score
